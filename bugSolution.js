The issue stems from not properly accessing and utilizing the `req` object from the `context` within the `getServerSideProps` function to access the cookies.  The solution is to access the cookies from the `req` object within the `getServerSideProps` function and include them in your fetch request.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { req, res } = context;
  const cookies = req.cookies;

  //Include cookies in the fetch request if needed
  const response = await fetch('api/profile', {
    headers: {
      'Cookie': cookies
    }
  });

  const profile = await response.json();

  return {
    props: {
      profile: profile,
    },
  };
}

// ... rest of the component
```
This corrected approach ensures that your data fetching methods have the necessary context to perform correctly.
